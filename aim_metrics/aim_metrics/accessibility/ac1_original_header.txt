   MoinMoin - Daltonize ImageCorrection - Effect

   Daltonize image correction algorithm implemented according to
   http://scien.stanford.edu/class/psych221/projects/05/ofidaner/colorblindness_project.htm

   Many thanks to Onur Fidaner, Poliang Lin and Nevran Ozguven for their work
   on this topic and for releasing their complete research results to the public
   (unlike the guys from http://www.vischeck.com/). This is of great help for a
   lot of people!

   Please note:
   Daltonize ImageCorrection needs
   * Python Image Library (PIL) from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
   * NumPy from http://numpy.scipy.org/

   You can call Daltonize from the command-line with
   "daltonize.py C:\image.png"

   Explanations:
       * Normally this module is called from Moin.AttachFile.get_file
       * @param filename, filepath is the filename/fullpath to an image in the attachment
         dir of a page.
       * @param color_deficit can either be
           - 'd' for Deuteranope image correction
           - 'p' for Protanope image correction
           - 't' for Tritanope image correct
   Idea:
       * Since daltonizing an image takes quite some time and we don't want visually
         impaired users to wait so long until the page is loaded, this module has a
         command-line option built-in which could be called as a separate process
         after a file upload of a non visually impaired user in "AttachFile", e.g
         "spawnlp(os.NO_WAIT...)"
       * "AttachFile": If an image attachment is deleted or overwritten by a new version
         please make sure to delete the daltonized images and redaltonize them.
       * But all in all: Concrete implementation of ImageCorrection needs further
         thinking and discussion. This is only a first prototype as proof of concept.
