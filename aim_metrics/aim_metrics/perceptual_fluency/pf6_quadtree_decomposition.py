#   Implemented by:
#   Thomas Langerak
#   (hello@thomaslangerak.nl)
#
#   Supervisor:
#   Antti Oulasvirta
#
#   This work was funded by Technology Industries of Finland in a three-year
#   project grant on self-optimizing web services. The principal investigator
#   is Antti Oulasvirta of Aalto University (antti.oulasvirta@aalto.fi)

# Summary #
###########
#
#   The orginial paper [2] proposes 14 metrics for evaluating layout. Currently three are implemented
#   for the other 11 metrics a better segmentation is needed. (Preferably for these three aswell). The three
#   metrics are balance, symmetry and equilibrium.
#
#   Balance can be defined as the distribution of optical weight in a picture.
#   Optical weight refers to the perception that some objects appear heavier than
#   others. Larger objects are heavier, whereas small objects are lighter. Balance in
#   screen design is achieved by providing an equal weight of screen elements, left
#   and right, top and bottom.
#
#   Symmetry is axial duplication: a unit on one side of the centre line is exactly
#   replicated on the other side. Vertical symmetry refers to the balanced arrangement
#   of equivalent elements about a vertical axis, and horizontal symmetry
#   about a horizontal axis. Radial symmetry consists of equivalent elements
#   balanced about two or more axes that intersect at a central point. In two seperate studies
#   this metric has not proven to be significant.
#
#   Equilibrium is a stabilisation, a midway centre of suspension. Equilibrium
#   on a screen is accomplished through centring the layout itself. The centre of the
#   layout coincides with that of the frame.
